## Getting started

Start write your documentation by adding more markdown (.md) files to this folder (/docs) or replace the content in this file.

## InnerSource

This project is setup following the [InnerSource Setup Checklist](https://backstage.int.bayer.com/docs/default/Component/reuse-guide/innersource-checklist/scorecard/#innersource-setup).  This enables it to be contribution ready, with a README, contributing guide, templates, and automated checks to validate contributions.  We would love it if you would join the InnerSource community at Bayer.  You can join the community and conversation on [MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Afb89c52c310e4c98bfa7972951341170%40thread.tacv2/InnerSource%20Community?groupId=68d22473-f3f2-46e0-9ed8-2bb9bb346356&tenantId=fcb2b37b-5da0-466b-9b83-0014b67a7c78) and learn more about InnerSource in the [The Software Assets Reusability Guide](https://backstage.int.bayer.com/docs/default/Component/reuse-guide).  

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents on the right is generated automatically based on the hierarchy
of headings. Only use one H1 (`#` in Markdown) per file.

## Site navigation

For new pages to appear in the left hand navigation you need edit the `mkdocs.yml`
file in root of your repo. The navigation can also link out to other sites.

Alternatively, if there is no `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`, a navigation section
will be created for you. However, you will not be able to use alternate titles for
pages, or include links to other sites.

Note that MkDocs uses `mkdocs.yml`, not `mkdocs.yaml`, although both appear to work.
